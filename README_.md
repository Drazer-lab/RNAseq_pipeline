# RNA Seq 

## Step 0: Build genome and transcriptome index for the aligner (HISAT2)

## Step 1: Quality control for FASTQ files

## Step 2: Merge reads of the same sample from different flow cells 

## Step 3: Alignment with HISAT2 

## Step 4: Quantification by Cufflinks

## Step 5: Pair-wise statistics by Cuffdiff
